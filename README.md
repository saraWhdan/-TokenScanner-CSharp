# -TokenScanner-CSharp


This repository contains a simple token scanner implemented in C#.  
  The program takes a sequence of tokens as input and categorizes them into various types, including keywords, symbols, operations, identifiers, comments, digits, and output to the user.

## Purpose

This project is developed as part of a university course on compilers.  
It serves as a practical implementation for understanding and exploring token scanning, a fundamental aspect of compiler design.
